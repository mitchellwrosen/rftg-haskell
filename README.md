rftg-haskell
============

Chris & Mitch (TM)'s Haskell implementation of [Keldon's RFTG AI] (http://keldon.net/rftg/),
purely for fun and to accrue Haskell coding experience. This program will never
be released for profit and will always remain open source. I can only hope that
us two university students can fly under the Copyright Infringement Radar by
virtue of our obscurity. All images and gameplay are copyright Rio Grande Games.

The following improvements are planned, in no particular order, nor guarantee
that they will ever be implemented:

- UI improvements
- - Better chat (separated from the log)
- - Better log (color coded, more clear what has happened)
- - More obvious game phases (it's too easy to not realize when you are supposed to do something)
- - More obvious which phases were picked each turn, as well as by whom

- Gameplay improvements
- - Undo "locked in" phase selection when not all players have locked in

- Additional features
- - Support for drafting mode (for 2-3 player TGS, RVI, BOW)
- - "Starter hand" option for starting worlds 1-5
